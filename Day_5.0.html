    <h1>ADHD</h1>
    <p>
      ADHD is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders of childhood.
      It is usually first diagnosed in childhood and often lasts into adulthood.
      Children with ADHD may have trouble paying attention, controlling
      impulsive behaviors (may act without thinking about what the result will
      be), or be overly active.
    </p>
    <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
    <p>
      It is normal for children to have trouble focusing and behaving at one
      time or another. However, children with ADHD do not just grow out of these
      behaviors. The symptoms continue, can be severe, and can cause difficulty
      at school, at home, or with friends.
